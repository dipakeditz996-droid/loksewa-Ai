"""Celery application for LoksewaAI's background jobs.

Two periodic jobs run here, both wrapping plain functions that are also
exposed as management commands (`dispatch_scheduled_notifications`,
`archive_expired_examinations`) so the logic itself can be run and verified
without a broker - only the *scheduling* needs Celery.

Nothing in this file makes those jobs actually run on a schedule by itself.
Production needs two extra long-running processes alongside gunicorn:
    celery -A backend worker --loglevel=info
    celery -A backend beat --loglevel=info
Both need CELERY_BROKER_URL (or REDIS_URL) pointing at a real Redis
instance - see Procfile for the process declarations.
