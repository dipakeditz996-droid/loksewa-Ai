"""Serves Drive-hosted media through our own domain instead of linking the
browser straight to Google's public CDN - see google_drive.get_file_url for
why (an undocumented per-referer rate limit on that CDN was breaking every
Drive-hosted image on the site for a browser that had loaded a burst of
pages). Every FileField/ImageField URL in the app points here.

No auth is required to fetch a file - this matches the security posture the
app already had under the R2/S3 setup it replaced (AWS_DEFAULT_ACL was
'public-read' there too), not a new gap introduced by this proxy. A student
with a saved link can still fetch a payment screenshot the way they always
could with a public-read S3 URL; per-file access control is a separate,
larger feature, not something this endpoint changes either way.
