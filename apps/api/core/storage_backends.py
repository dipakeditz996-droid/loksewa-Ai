"""Custom Django Storage backend backed by Google Drive.

Wired in as STORAGES['default']['BACKEND'] in settings.py when Drive is
configured, so existing FileField/ImageField model fields and the manual
default_storage.save() avatar-upload pattern both transparently use Drive
with no other code changes.

Naming scheme: Django computes the desired relative path itself (via each
field's upload_to), e.g. "courses/thumbnails/foo.jpg". Drive has no concept
of a path or of "this name is taken" the way a filesystem does - every
upload becomes a new object with its own opaque file ID, and two files can
share a name in the same folder. To let _url()/delete()/_open() resolve a
saved name back to the right Drive object with NO extra API call (url() in
particular needs to be cheap - it can run on every list-page render), the
Drive file ID is folded into the *returned* name as a filename prefix:
"courses/thumbnails/<file_id>__foo.jpg". That returned value is what
actually gets stored in the model's FileField/ImageField column.

    Django's FileField.generate_filename() builds names via pathlib.PurePath,

    upload_to values are written with forward slashes. Normalize first so
    routing/parsing behaves the same on Windows dev and Linux production.
